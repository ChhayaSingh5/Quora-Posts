Quora-style Post Web App (Backend)
This Quora-style Post Web Application (Backend only) is designed to provide basic functionality for creating, viewing, editing, and deleting posts — just like how users interact on platforms like Quora.

Technologies Used:
1. Node.js
2. Express.js
3. EJS (Embedded JavaScript)
4. HTML (in views)
5. CSS (in public folder for styling)

Packages/Libraries Used:
1. uuid – to generate unique IDs for each post
2. method-override – to support PUT & DELETE requests via HTML forms
3. express.static – to serve static files like CSS
